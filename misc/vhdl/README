This is the VHDL for the design that takes serial data from the GPS RF frontend and converts them into bytes for the FPGA's EPP-like interface.

I've added a two-bit sequence numbers, so I've got a one in four chance of detecting buffer overruns when the data is recevied.

You will need to add an IP block FIFO for this design to work
